How to Contribute to FactoryJS
==============================

We write coffeescript in this project, so write that. If you submit a pull request and the tests don't pass for it, you will probably die soon from something painful. The scope of the project is pretty small so try to keep the commits relevant to bug fixes.

Anything you write should get reflected in the documentation (that would be nice). Anyway, fork the repo, make your changes and make a pull request. That's about it.
